# Chooze-Your-Tunze
This website was created for users to have a place where they can showcase, they favorite songs, artists, and albums to other people.  
The website features four distinct pages, with may pages having additional content/functions. 
The main page shows the top-rated songs from the website, as well as the top-rated artist and album. 
The main page also features quite a bit of jQuery Mobile, which allows users to click and see a brief description of the websiteâ€™s hot items. 
The three others pages, songs, artists, and albums, all feature jQuery and web storage. 
These features allow a user to input their information and have the information displayed in on the website. 
This action is accomplished through the form at the bottom of the page, and by pushing the submit button. 
All the pages are roughly the same, minus the key item they are showcasing.
